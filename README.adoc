Support to build Docker images for SolarView

== Description
This project contains files to support building Docker images for http://www.solarview.info/solarview_linux.aspx[SolarView] and its proxy applications.

== Usage
1. Create a GitLab CI configuration for the SolarView application. Suppose we want to build a Docker image for a SolarView proxy _foo-fb_:
+
..gitlab-ci.yml
[source,yaml]
----
include:
  remote: 'https://github.com/git-developer/solarview-base/raw/v1.0.0/.gitlab-ci.yml'

variables:
  DOCKERFILE_URL: 'https://github.com/git-developer/solarview-base/raw/v1.0.0/Dockerfile'
  BUILD_ARGS: 'APP_NAME=foo-fb'
  IMAGE_TITLE: 'SolarView foo-Proxy'
----
1. Build the project with GitLab CI.

The build will create Docker images for the platforms `linux/i386` and `linux/arm/v7`, add labels, tag them with version and date and publish them to the Docker registry.
